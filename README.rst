If you check out one thing, let it be the
`tutorial in the iPython notbeook viewer
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/tbekolay/pyconca2012/master/QuantitiesTutorial.ipynb>`_!

The compiled slides are available as a download
`here <https://github.com/downloads/tbekolay/pyconca2012/slides.pdf>`_.
LaTeX sources for the slides are in ``latex-src``,
and figures are in ``figures``.

To run all of the examples, you will need:

- NumPy
- Quantities
- Matplotlib

The examples from the slides can be run
as either an IPython notebook (``SlideExamples.ipynb``)
or as a standalone Python file (``SlideExamples.py``).

A more fleshed out tutorial which differs in some
small ways from the talk can be found in
``QuantitiesTutorial.ipynb`` and ``QuantitiesTutorial.py``.
